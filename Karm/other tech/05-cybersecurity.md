## Introduction & Purpose

### Why This Domain Matters

Cybersecurity has become the backbone of our digital society, protecting critical infrastructure, personal data, and national security in an increasingly connected world. As cyber threats evolve from simple viruses to sophisticated nation-state attacks, the need for robust security measures has never been greater.

The economic impact is staggering. Cybersecurity failures cost the global economy trillions annually, with incidents like the Equifax breach affecting millions and causing billions in damages. Organizations that invest in cybersecurity gain competitive advantages through customer trust, regulatory compliance, and operational resilience.

Beyond economics, cybersecurity touches every aspect of modern life. It protects democratic processes from foreign interference, safeguards healthcare systems from ransomware, and ensures financial systems remain trustworthy. Understanding cybersecurity is crucial for building ethical technology that respects user privacy while maintaining system integrity.
