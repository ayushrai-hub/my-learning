## Introduction & Purpose

### Why This Domain Matters

Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Extended Reality (XR) represent the next evolution of human-computer interaction, creating immersive experiences that blend digital and physical worlds. These technologies are transforming industries from gaming and entertainment to education, healthcare, manufacturing, and remote work.

The economic impact is transformative. The AR/VR/XR market is projected to reach $300 billion by 2024, with applications in metaverse development, remote collaboration, training simulations, and digital commerce. The metaverse alone could create a $13 trillion market by 2030, fundamentally changing how humans work, learn, and socialize.

Beyond economics, XR technologies touch fundamental aspects of human experience. AR enhances real-world perception with digital information, VR creates entirely new realities, and XR seamlessly blends both. These technologies will revolutionize education through immersive learning, healthcare through remote surgery and therapy, and work through virtual collaboration spaces.
