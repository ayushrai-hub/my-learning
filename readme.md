## 🎯 Ideal Engineer Profile

Both platforms develop engineers with these core capabilities:

| Capability                            | What it looks like in practice                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Full-Stack Delivery**               | Ship a React + FastAPI feature, wire it to Postgres & Redis, and expose a versioned REST/GraphQL API—within the same sprint.   |
| **Platform & DevOps**                 | Write a Helm chart, push a signed multi-arch image, and debug a failing pod with `kubectl debug`—without paging an infra team. |
| **ML & AI Engineering**               | Build a streaming ETL on Kafka/Flink, fine-tune an LLM with LoRA, deploy it behind an autoscaled inference endpoint, and implement RAG systems with vector databases. |
| **Reliability & Observability First** | Define SLOs, add OpenTelemetry traces, craft RED dashboards, and run a chaos game-day.                                         |
| **Security & Compliance**             | Threat-model new features, enforce OPA policies in CI, and ship SBOM-signed artifacts.                                         |
| **Human Skills**                      | Write clear RFCs, mentor juniors, run blameless post-mortems, and negotiate trade-offs with PMs.                               |

> **Short-hand:** think _"Staff-level Software Engineer who can play Backend, Frontend, SRE, Platform, ML-Ops, and AI Engineering—while still speaking product."_
