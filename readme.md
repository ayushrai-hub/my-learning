> **Transform engineers into Product-Oriented Systems Engineers with ML/AI Engineering Mastery**

This repository contains a comprehensive, **modular curriculum** designed to develop full-stack, systems-savvy engineers with deep ML and AI engineering expertise. Graduates become **Product-Oriented Systems Engineers with ML/AI Engineering Mastery** who can build, deploy, and scale intelligent systems while maintaining platform reliability and security expertise.

## 🎯 Ideal Engineer Profile

The curriculum develops engineers with these core capabilities:

| Capability                            | What it looks like in practice                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Full-Stack Delivery**               | Ship a React + FastAPI feature, wire it to Postgres & Redis, and expose a versioned REST/GraphQL API—within the same sprint.   |
| **Platform & DevOps**                 | Write a Helm chart, push a signed multi-arch image, and debug a failing pod with `kubectl debug`—without paging an infra team. |
| **ML & AI Engineering**               | Build a streaming ETL on Kafka/Flink, fine-tune an LLM with LoRA, deploy it behind an autoscaled inference endpoint, and implement RAG systems with vector databases. |
| **Reliability & Observability First** | Define SLOs, add OpenTelemetry traces, craft RED dashboards, and run a chaos game-day.                                         |
| **Security & Compliance**             | Threat-model new features, enforce OPA policies in CI, and ship SBOM-signed artifacts.                                         |
| **Human Skills**                      | Write clear RFCs, mentor juniors, run blameless post-mortems, and negotiate trade-offs with PMs.                               |

> **Short-hand:** think _"Staff-level Software Engineer who can play Backend, Frontend, SRE, Platform, ML-Ops, and AI Engineering—while still speaking product."_


## 📚 Modular Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized as a **pure modular structure** with descriptive, non-numbered section files for maximum flexibility:
