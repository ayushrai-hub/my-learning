# Cloud Platforms & Architecture

- **Cloud Fundamentals & Shared Responsibility**

  - Shared responsibility model: infrastructure, platform, software layers, security boundaries
  - Cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS, trade-offs, use cases
  - Multi-cloud strategy: vendor lock-in avoidance, best-of-breed, complexity management
  - Hybrid cloud: on-premises integration, data sovereignty, compliance, connectivity
  - Edge computing: CDN, edge functions, IoT, latency optimization, distributed architecture
  - Cloud economics: pricing models, cost optimization, reserved instances, spot instances
  - Compliance: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, industry-specific requirements

- **Network Architecture & Connectivity**

  - Virtual Private Cloud: subnets, routing tables, NAT gateways, internet gateways
  - Network segmentation: security groups, NACLs, micro-segmentation, zero trust
  - Load balancing: application load balancer, network load balancer, global load balancer
  - DNS management: Route 53, Cloud DNS, health checks, failover, geolocation routing
  - VPN connectivity: site-to-site VPN, client VPN, direct connect, private peering
  - Content delivery: CDN configuration, edge locations, cache policies, origin shielding
  - Network monitoring: flow logs, packet capture, latency monitoring, security analysis

- **Identity & Access Management**

  - IAM principles: least privilege, separation of duties, defense in depth, zero trust
  - Identity providers: Active Directory, LDAP, SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect, federation
  - Role-based access: roles, policies, groups, service accounts, temporary credentials
  - Multi-factor authentication: TOTP, SMS, hardware tokens, biometrics, risk-based
  - Privileged access: break-glass procedures, just-in-time access, session recording
  - API security: API keys, JWT tokens, OAuth scopes, rate limiting, threat detection
  - Compliance: audit logs, access reviews, certification, governance, policy enforcement

- **Auto-scaling & Resource Management**

  - Auto-scaling groups: scaling policies, health checks, instance replacement, lifecycle hooks
  - Horizontal scaling: load distribution, stateless design, session management, data consistency
  - Vertical scaling: instance sizing, resource limits, performance monitoring, cost optimization
  - Predictive scaling: machine learning, historical patterns, seasonal adjustments, proactive scaling
  - Container orchestration: Kubernetes, ECS, auto-scaling, resource requests, limits
  - Serverless scaling: function concurrency, cold starts, warm-up strategies, cost optimization
  - Resource tagging: cost allocation, governance, automation, lifecycle management

- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**

  - Recovery objectives: RTO, RPO, business impact analysis, service tier classification
  - Backup strategies: full, incremental, differential, point-in-time recovery, cross-region
  - Replication: synchronous, asynchronous, multi-region, conflict resolution, consistency
  - Failover procedures: automated failover, manual failover, health checks, DNS switching
  - DR testing: regular testing, runbooks, communication plans, lessons learned
  - Business continuity: risk assessment, impact analysis, recovery procedures, communication
  - Compliance: regulatory requirements, audit trails, documentation, reporting

- **Cost Optimization & FinOps**
  - Cost visibility: billing dashboards, cost allocation, tagging strategies, showback/chargeback
  - Right-sizing: instance optimization, utilization monitoring, performance analysis
  - Reserved capacity: reserved instances, savings plans, commitment analysis, portfolio optimization
  - Spot instances: workload suitability, interruption handling, cost savings, automation
  - Storage optimization: lifecycle policies, compression, deduplication, tiering
  - Network costs: data transfer, CDN usage, peering, bandwidth optimization
  - FinOps practices: cost governance, budgets, alerts, optimization recommendations
