# Product & Data-Driven Engineering

- **A/B Testing & Experimentation Frameworks**

  - Experimental design: control groups, randomization, stratification
  - Statistical power analysis: sample size calculation, effect size
  - Split.io: feature flags, targeting rules, gradual rollouts
  - LaunchDarkly: user segmentation, kill switches, analytics
  - Optimizely: visual editor, multivariate testing, personalization
  - Hypothesis formation: metrics selection, success criteria

- **Feature Flags & Progressive Delivery**

  - Feature flag types: release, operational, permission, experiment
  - Flag lifecycle management: creation, testing, cleanup
  - Targeting strategies: user attributes, percentage rollouts
  - Kill switches: emergency rollback, blast radius limitation
  - Flag evaluation: client-side vs server-side, caching
  - Technical debt: flag cleanup, code branching complexity

- **Analytics & User Behavior Tracking**

  - Event tracking: user actions, page views, custom events
  - Amplitude: behavioral cohorts, funnel analysis, retention curves
  - Mixpanel: event properties, user profiles, segmentation
  - Google Analytics: traffic sources, conversion tracking, goals
  - Data collection: client-side vs server-side tracking
  - Privacy compliance: GDPR, CCPA, consent management

- **Business Metrics & KPI Development**

  - North Star metrics: user value alignment, business impact
  - AARRR framework: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue
  - Conversion funnels: step-by-step analysis, drop-off identification
  - Cohort analysis: user retention, lifetime value calculation
  - Leading vs lagging indicators: predictive vs outcome metrics
  - Metric trees: decomposition, driver identification

- **Statistical Analysis & Experimentation**

  - Hypothesis testing: null hypothesis, p-values, confidence intervals
  - Type I/II errors: false positives, false negatives, power analysis
  - Multiple testing correction: Bonferroni, FDR, family-wise error
  - Bayesian A/B testing: prior beliefs, posterior distributions
  - Sequential testing: early stopping, alpha spending functions
  - Sample ratio mismatch: detection, causes, mitigation

- **Customer Feedback & Research Integration**
  - User research methods: interviews, surveys, usability testing
  - Feedback collection: in-app surveys, NPS, support integration
  - Qualitative analysis: thematic analysis, user journey mapping
  - Voice of customer: feedback categorization, sentiment analysis
  - Research repository: insights storage, searchability, sharing
  - Product discovery: problem validation, solution validation
- A/B testing frameworks (Split.io, LaunchDarkly, Optimizely)
- Feature flags & progressive rollouts, canary analysis
- User analytics & event tracking (Amplitude, Mixpanel)
- Business metrics & KPIs, conversion funnels
- Product experimentation design & statistical significance
- Customer feedback loops & user research integration
