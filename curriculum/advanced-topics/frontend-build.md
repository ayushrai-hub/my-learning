# Front-End Build & Performance Pipeline

- **Modern Build Tools & Bundlers**

  - Vite: fast dev server, hot module replacement, optimized builds, plugin ecosystem
  - esbuild: ultra-fast bundling, TypeScript support, tree shaking, code splitting
  - Turbopack: incremental bundling, caching, parallel processing, Webpack successor
  - Webpack: module federation, advanced optimization, plugin ecosystem, configuration
  - Rollup: library bundling, tree shaking, ES modules, plugin architecture
  - Parcel: zero-configuration, automatic optimization, multi-target builds
  - Build optimization: bundle analysis, performance profiling, optimization strategies

- **Code Splitting & Optimization**

  - Route-based splitting: lazy loading, dynamic imports, chunk optimization
  - Component-based splitting: code splitting strategies, bundle size optimization
  - Tree shaking: dead code elimination, ES modules, side effects, optimization
  - Bundle analysis: webpack-bundle-analyzer, source maps, size tracking
  - Caching strategies: long-term caching, cache busting, service worker integration
  - Compression: gzip, brotli, asset compression, delivery optimization
  - Performance budgets: size limits, performance monitoring, CI integration

- **CSS Architecture & Strategies**

  - CSS Modules: scoped styles, composition, theming, build integration
  - Styled Components: CSS-in-JS, dynamic styling, theming, server-side rendering
  - Tailwind CSS: utility-first, design systems, customization, build optimization
  - PostCSS: CSS processing, autoprefixer, custom properties, optimization
  - Sass/SCSS: preprocessing, mixins, variables, modular architecture
  - CSS Grid & Flexbox: modern layouts, responsive design, browser support
  - Critical CSS: above-the-fold optimization, inline CSS, performance impact

- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**

  - Service workers: caching strategies, offline functionality, background sync
  - Web app manifest: installability, app-like experience, platform integration
  - Caching strategies: cache-first, network-first, stale-while-revalidate
  - Offline functionality: offline pages, data synchronization, user experience
  - Push notifications: web push, notification API, user engagement
  - App shell architecture: application shell, dynamic content, performance
  - PWA auditing: Lighthouse audits, PWA criteria, optimization recommendations

- **Asset Optimization & Delivery**
  - Image optimization: WebP, AVIF, responsive images, lazy loading, compression
  - Font optimization: font loading strategies, font display, subsetting, preloading
  - SVG optimization: SVGO, inline SVG, icon systems, accessibility
  - Video optimization: format selection, compression, adaptive streaming, lazy loading
  - CDN integration: asset delivery, edge caching, geographic distribution
  - Resource hints: preload, prefetch, preconnect, DNS prefetch, performance impact
