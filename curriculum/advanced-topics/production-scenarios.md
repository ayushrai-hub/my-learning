# Production Integration Scenarios

- **Multi-Service Feature Development**

  - Cross-team coordination: feature planning, dependency management, timeline alignment
  - API contract design: interface definition, backward compatibility, versioning strategy
  - Integration testing: service interaction, end-to-end workflows, data consistency
  - Deployment orchestration: service deployment order, rollback procedures, coordination
  - Feature flags: gradual rollout, A/B testing, risk mitigation, configuration management
  - Monitoring: cross-service metrics, distributed tracing, error correlation, alerting
  - Documentation: integration guides, API documentation, troubleshooting, runbooks

- **Production Debugging Workflows**

  - Incident triage: severity assessment, impact analysis, resource allocation, escalation
  - Cross-service investigation: distributed tracing, log correlation, dependency analysis
  - Debugging tools: APM tools, log aggregation, profiling, real-time monitoring
  - Collaboration: war room coordination, expertise sharing, decision making, communication
  - Root cause analysis: systematic investigation, hypothesis testing, evidence gathering
  - Resolution strategies: hotfixes, rollbacks, configuration changes, traffic routing
  - Knowledge capture: incident documentation, lessons learned, process improvement

- **Capacity Planning Scenarios**
  - Traffic spike preparation: load testing, capacity modeling, resource provisioning
  - Seasonal planning: historical analysis, growth projections, resource scaling
  - Marketing campaigns: traffic estimation, infrastructure preparation, monitoring
  - Product launches: capacity requirements, performance testing, rollback plans
  - Cost optimization: resource efficiency, right-sizing, reserved capacity, spot instances
  - Performance monitoring: real-time metrics, alerting, capacity utilization, bottlenecks
  - Scaling automation: auto-scaling policies, predictive scaling, manual overrides
