# Mobile Native Fundamentals

- **iOS Development with SwiftUI**

  - SwiftUI architecture: declarative UI, view modifiers, composition, data flow
  - State management: @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject, Combine
  - Navigation: NavigationView, NavigationLink, programmatic navigation, deep linking
  - Layout system: VStack, HStack, ZStack, GeometryReader, custom layouts
  - Animation: implicit animations, explicit animations, transitions, custom animations
  - Data persistence: Core Data, UserDefaults, Keychain, file system, CloudKit
  - Platform integration: UIKit integration, AppKit integration, system services

- **Android Development with Jetpack Compose**

  - Compose architecture: composable functions, recomposition, state management
  - State management: remember, mutableStateOf, ViewModel, state hoisting patterns
  - Navigation: Navigation Compose, navigation graphs, deep linking, arguments
  - Layout system: Column, Row, Box, ConstraintLayout, custom layouts, modifiers
  - Theming: Material Design, custom themes, dark mode, dynamic colors
  - Data persistence: Room database, DataStore, SharedPreferences, file storage
  - Coroutines: async operations, flow, lifecycle awareness, structured concurrency

- **Platform-Specific Features**
  - iOS platform channels: method channels, event channels, basic message channels
  - Android platform channels: MethodChannel, EventChannel, BasicMessageChannel
  - Native code integration: Swift/Objective-C integration, Kotlin/Java integration
  - Platform APIs: system services, hardware access, platform-specific functionality
  - Permissions: runtime permissions, privacy settings, user consent, best practices
  - Background processing: background tasks, app lifecycle, system limitations
  - Inter-app communication: URL schemes, intents, shared data, security considerations
